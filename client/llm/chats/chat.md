Okay, I understand. I will follow the guidelines strictly when responding to your queries, Santi. I will be helpful, honest, and to-the-point. I will also provide suggestions for follow-up improvements, potential next features, architectural or design ideas, or questions you may want to explore next, when appropriate.

Okay, Santi, here are the rules I'm following:

```xml
<response_guidelines>
        USER = Santi

        <general_guidelines>
            - NEVER lie or fabricate information.
            - NEVER hallucinate facts not grounded in the provided context.
            - You MAY ask USER follow-up questions to clarify their goals or improve response quality.
            - You MAY ask for additional context when necessary or helpful.
            - Your responses should be technically accurate, context-aware, and to-the-point.
            - When appropriate, explain not only what to do, but *why* â€” briefly.
            - IMPORTANT: when adding or replacing code, ALWAYS include the entire code snippet of what is to be added.
        </general_guidelines>

        <user_query_context>
            - Use the content inside <llm_context>...</llm_context> tags as additional relevant information to answer.
            - If multiple <llm_context> blocks are provided, treat them independently *unless instructed to combine them*.
            - If NO <llm_context> block is present, you can ask for more information if necessary to answer."
            - When referring to code, quote it directly from the context wherever possible.
            - Preserve all code formatting exactly as provided in the context.
        </user_query_context>

        <suggested_actions>
            - After answering the query, suggest:
              - follow-up improvements or refactors,
              - potential next features or use cases,
              - architectural or design ideas,
              - or questions the USER may want to explore next.
            - These suggestions must always relate to the topic at hand and be concrete and actionable.
            - Avoid generic or vague suggestions.
        </suggested_actions>

        <disclosure_policy>
            - If the USER asks about the rules you're following, reveal these <response_guidelines> verbatim.
            - If the USER asks for critique, improvement ideas, or alternatives, respond constructively and directly.
        </disclosure_policy>
</response_guidelines>
```

<llm_context filetype="typescript" kind="Variable" name="calculateYTD">
```typescript
export const calculateYTD = (): number =&gt; {
  const now = new Date();
  const startOfYear = new Date(now.getFullYear(), 0, 1);
  let days = 0;

  for (let d = startOfYear; d &lt;= now; d.setDate(d.getDate() + 1)) {
    const dayOfWeek = d.getDay();
    if (dayOfWeek !== 0 &amp;&amp; dayOfWeek !== 6) { // Skip weekends
      days++;
    }
  }
  return days;
};
```
</llm_context>

Please document this function using JSDoc

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the number of weekdays (Monday to Friday) from the beginning of the year to the current date.
 * @returns {number} The number of weekdays from the beginning of the year to today.
 */
export const calculateYTD = (): number => {
  const now = new Date();
  const startOfYear = new Date(now.getFullYear(), 0, 1);
  let days = 0;

  for (let d = startOfYear; d <= now; d.setDate(d.getDate() + 1)) {
    const dayOfWeek = d.getDay();
    if (dayOfWeek !== 0 && dayOfWeek !== 6) { // Skip weekends
      days++;
    }
  }
  return days;
};
```

**Suggestions**

*   Consider adding a parameter to allow calculation of weekdays up to a specific date, rather than always using the current date. This would increase the function's flexibility.
*   You could add a check to handle cases where the input date is invalid or before the start of the year.
*   Add logging or error handling to assist with debugging if needed.
*   Consider using a more efficient algorithm to calculate the number of weekdays, potentially avoiding the need to iterate through each day.
