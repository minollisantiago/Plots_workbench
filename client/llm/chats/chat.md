Would you combine these two constants of keep them separated? They are inside a react component:

<llm_context filetype="typescriptreact" kind="Variable" name="combinedSeries">
```typescriptreact
  const combinedSeries = useMemo(() => {
    // only combine the series if filteredSeries has 2 TimeSeriesData objects in it.
    if (filteredSeries.length !== 2) return undefined;
    return combineSeriesToScatter(
      filteredSeries[0],
      filteredSeries[1],
      "combined",
      "combined",
    );
  }, [filteredSeries]);
```
</llm_context>

<llm_context filetype="typescriptreact" kind="Variable" name="plotData">
```typescriptreact
  const plotData = useMemo(() => {
    if (!combinedSeries) return undefined;
    return (prepareScatterData([combinedSeries]));
  }, [combinedSeries]);
```
</llm_context>


WE first combined two series and then prepare them for plotly compliant data arrays.

It's generally better to keep `combinedSeries` and `plotData` separated for the following reasons:

*   **Clarity and Readability**: Separating the concerns of combining the series and preparing the data for plotting makes the code easier to understand. Each `useMemo` hook has a single, clear responsibility.
*   **Testability**:  Separating the logic allows you to more easily test the `combineSeriesToScatter` and `prepareScatterData` functions independently.
*   **Maintainability**: If the way you prepare the data for plotting changes in the future, you only need to modify the `plotData` `useMemo` hook. If you combine them, you'd have to modify a single, larger block of code.
*   **Debugging**: When debugging, it's easier to isolate issues when the logic is separated. You can inspect `combinedSeries` to ensure the series are being combined correctly before the plotting data is prepared.

Given the current code, combining them would not offer significant performance benefits and would reduce readability.

Some potential next steps are:

*   Consider adding unit tests for `combineSeriesToScatter` and `prepareScatterData` to ensure they are working as expected.
*   If you find that `filteredSeries` often has fewer or more than 2 elements, you could add a check at the beginning of the component to avoid unnecessary calculations.
*   You could create a custom hook that encapsulates the combination and preparation logic if you find yourself repeating this pattern in multiple components.
