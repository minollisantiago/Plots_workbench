Could you summarize these commits for me, focus on the last two weeks

Okay, here's a summary of the commit history, focusing on the last two weeks (approximately April 4th, 2025 to April 17th, 2025):

**Focus:** Refactoring plotting components, LLM integration, and documentation updates.

*   **Plotting Component Refactor:** A significant effort was made to refactor the plotting components. This included:
    *   Moving away from a single `PlotCanvas` component to specific `Plot` components for better state management.
    *   Creating a generic plotting component with Plotly layout and plot functionality.
    *   Refactoring plot layout and theme models with improved typing.
    *   Adding a scatter plot component with models and utilities.
    *   Fixing configuration imports after removing `plot.config` from the library.
*   **LLM Integration:** Work was done to integrate LLMs (Large Language Models) into the project. This included:
    *   Updating cursor rules for UI components.
    *   Updating `.gitignore` files to ignore task-related markdown files generated by agents.
    *   Adding new rules for task creation and management.
    *   Adding new cursor rules for naming conventions and type declarations for components, hooks, and functions.
*   **UI Component Enhancements:** A new `Loading` custom component was added for displaying loading states when fetching data.
*   **Documentation Updates:** The `README` was updated with UI component library references, a general cursor rule for creating new rules, component header fixes, project structure diagrams, and work on a PRD for LLMs.
*   **Canvas Improvements:** Several improvements were made to the canvas components, including:
    *   Updating the relative offset of new canvases when the user pans around the screen.
    *   Ensuring new canvases are rendered at the center of the screen, even after panning.
*   **Keybinds:** The keybind element was added to display the keybind for centering the workspace, and special keys were included in the `useKeybind` custom hook.
